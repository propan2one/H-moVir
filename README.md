## Abstract

The genetic diversity of viral populations has become a major issue in the understanding of their phylogeographic and dissemination history, but it represents a real challenge when studying whole-genome viral diversity in the natural environment. These molecular ecological approaches to study viral diversity are commonly used for RNA viruses harboring small genomes but have not been applied to DNA viruses with large genomes. In this study we used the “Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome” (POMS, a disease that affects oyster farms around the world) as a model to study the genetic diversity of its causative agent, the Ostreid herpes virus 1 (OsHV-1) in the three most important French oyster-farming areas. Using ultra-deep sequencing on individual moribund oysters and new bioinformatics methodology we de novo assembled twenty one OsHV-1 genomes. Then, using a combination of whole-genomes comparison, phylogenetic analysis and quantification of major and minor variants we unveiled the connectivity of OsHV-1 viral populations between the three oyster-farming areas. We propose a scenario in which the Marennes-Oléron basin would be the main source of OsHV-1 diversity which would then be dispersed to other farming areas, a hypothesis consistent with the current knowledge on oyster transfers in France. In conclusion, this study showed that molecular ecological approaches may be applied to large genome virus to unravel the extent of their genetic diversity and better understand the spread of viral populations in natural environments.
